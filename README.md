# tgbc-angular
TGBC Website and Admin Dashboard developed with Angular.

This project utilizes Angular, a comprehensive framework chosen for its flexibility and scalability. Unlike solutions that may require integrating multiple libraries, Angular provides a complete development environment. This standardization can streamline the development process for teams and reduce the initial learning curve for developers familiar with the framework's opinionated structure.
